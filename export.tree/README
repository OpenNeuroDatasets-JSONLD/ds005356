Howdy y'all.   Here's data from Pirrung et al. (pending): Hypoactivation of ventromedial frontal cortex in major depressive disorder:
an MEG study (306-sensor Elekta Neuromag System) of the Reward Positivity.  Participants were all SCID interviewed to meet either control (CTL, non-depressed, n=38) or major depressive disorder (MDD, n=52) group criteria.   Task was an MEG-compatible probabilistic selection task.  We'll upload their T1s and resting state soon.
